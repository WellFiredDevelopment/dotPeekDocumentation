.Peek Documentation
===================

Welcome to the official documentation for .Peek, a Unity editor tool that allows you to automatically generate a report of 
the used (and unused) assets in your builds, and keep an eye on the evolution of your project assets in a nicely integrated and 
responsive interface.

If you are reading the .pdf version of this documentation, you may find the online version easier to navigate. 
It is accessible on `https://dotpeek-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/2018.2/ <https://dotpeek-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/2018.2/>`_.

We recommend you read the :ref:`doc_general_introduction` to get an overview of what this documentation
has to offer.

The table of contents below and in the sidebar should let you easily access the documentation for your topic of
interest. You can also use the search function in the top left corner.
