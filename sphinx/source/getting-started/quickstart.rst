Quick Start
===========

Your first build report
-----------------------

1. After installing .Peek, .Peek window is accessible through the menu **Window** > **DotPeek** in Unity Editor. Click on it 
   to open .Peek interface : the list of build reports is empty ;(

2. Build your project for one of the supported platforms : Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS or Android.

3. At the end of the build, .Peek should open by itself and display the new build report.

Congratualation ! You generated your first build report !
